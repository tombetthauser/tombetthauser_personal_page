  <h1>ANNOUNCEMENT FROM THE OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA</h1>
  <p><strong>Date:</strong> June 8, 2025<br>
     <strong>Contact:</strong> Office of the Governor, Communications Division</p>

  <h2>Outline for the New California Housing Authority (nCHA)</h2>
  <h3>A Bold Institutional Commitment to Solve California’s Interlinked Housing, Infrastructure, Energy, and Human Development Crises</h3>

  <h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
  <p>California today stands at a historic crossroads. While the state boasts the world’s fifth-largest economy and leads in technological innovation, it simultaneously faces some of the most acute challenges in housing affordability, infrastructure development, homelessness, environmental degradation, and income inequality.</p>
  <p>The formation of the <strong>New California Housing Authority (nCHA)</strong> is a direct and ambitious response to these intersecting crises. Drawing inspiration from the historical example of the <strong>Hong Kong Housing Authority</strong>, which after the devastating Shek Kip Mei fire in 1953 provided safe housing for over 200,000 people in three years, the nCHA will act as a sovereign institution empowered to fast-track housing and infrastructure development in California.</p>
  <p>The nCHA is envisioned as an <strong>independent, constitutionally authorized, self-sustaining authority</strong> that builds, operates, and governs housing developments, transit networks, energy production systems, food security programs, and comprehensive social services. It is intended not only to <strong>solve urgent housing and development challenges</strong> in California but also to <strong>serve as a replicable proof-of-concept for the nation and the world</strong>.</p>

  <h2>PRACTICAL NECESSITIES FOR THE nCHA</h2>

  <h3>1. Housing Affordability & Shortages</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Median home prices in California exceeded <strong>$800,000 in 2024</strong>, more than twice the national average.</li>
    <li>Over <strong>181,000 individuals in California are currently unhoused</strong>, accounting for nearly <strong>30% of the total U.S. homeless population</strong>.</li>
    <li>Low-income renters face a shortage of over <strong>980,000 affordable rental homes</strong>, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2. Broken Development Processes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Environmental reviews and permitting processes delay construction by <strong>5–10 years on average</strong>.</li>
    <li>Fragmented jurisdiction creates duplicated and conflicting requirements.</li>
    <li>Litigation from competing interests frequently halts projects before ground is broken.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3. Lack of Integrated Infrastructure</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Transit remains concentrated in coastal metros while inland areas are underserved.</li>
    <li>The energy grid is fragile and lacks localized renewable sources.</li>
    <li>Food security remains vulnerable, especially in rural and low-income areas.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4. Climate & Social Imperatives</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>California is at risk of missing both housing and climate targets.</li>
    <li>Working Californians are increasingly unable to afford rent or build wealth.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>THE STRUCTURE & MISSION OF THE nCHA</h2>
  <p>The <strong>New California Housing Authority (nCHA)</strong> will operate <strong>independently from existing regulatory systems</strong>, with powers to meet the state’s housing and infrastructure needs.</p>

  <h3>1. Housing Construction at Unprecedented Scale</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Design and build <strong>millions of climate-resilient housing units</strong>.</li>
    <li>Prioritize <strong>undeveloped or underutilized land</strong>.</li>
    <li>Include <strong>transportation, healthcare, education, and food access</strong> in every development.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2. Regulatory Supersession & Acceleration</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>nCHA may override zoning restrictions and environmental delays.</li>
    <li>Use internal review processes to replace CEQA where needed.</li>
    <li>Maintain <strong>limited legal liability</strong> to avoid obstruction.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3. Expanded Eminent Domain</h3>

    “In times of crisis, California has always built. From aqueducts to semiconductors, we lead by example. The nCHA will be our boldest example yet — proof that we can house our people, power our economy, feed our families, and create abundance for our state.”
