Blog Haikus

I don't like writing. I don't like how my writing feels when I read it and I don't like how long it takes for me to write something. But writing is clearly important professionally for artists and software people. It would be cool if every thought or idea could be conveyed through a wacky personal software project or series of paintings etc. But realistically there are a lot of important ideas that feel more appropriate to communicate quickly / directly through writing.

While trolling gpt4o to write haikus about llms writing haikus I realized haikus are awesome. They are quick to write, they destroy any weird writing voice or style and they are quick to read. It would be cool if you take the same ideas that would go into a blog post, essay or short story and just make it a haiku. But if you try to write an actual short blog post in a literal haiku format it's obviously too constraining. So if the 5-7-5 syllable structure is too short maybe 5-7-5 sentences would make sense. That's what I'm trying here. I quickly vibe coded a little web interface that constrained three paragraphs to 5 sentences, seven sentences and 5 sentences respectively and then exports them in raw text or html to your clipboard (vibe coding is terrible) and this is my first real attempt to use it.

So that's the basic idea. Three paragraphs, five sentences, seven sentences and then 5 sentences again. This still feels like writing and I don't love it but it's better than nothing and it satisfies the professional need to get certain thoughts or responses written out. And I'm hoping it might make other forms of writing more accessible / enjoyable for me as well, maybe even some bad short science fiction which the world always needs more of. And at the very least I can contribute my small part in continuing to create mediocre content for future AI models to scrape from the web and train off of.
