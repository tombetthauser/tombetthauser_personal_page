    <b>Socratic Misalignment</b> 
    <i>/soʊˈkrætɪk ˌmɪzəˈlaɪnmənt/ n.</i>
    <p>A completely made up concept describing a disconnect between the perceived and actual motivations behind human information-seeking behavior. While questions are often interpreted as efforts to acquire facts, Socratic Misalignment suggests that many are primarily social or emotional in function. The term references Socratic dialogue, where questioning was framed as a path to truth, and contrasts this with the modern tendency to ask in order to connect, not necessarily to know.</p>
    <p>Theory could be considered especially relevant in the context of the rise of search engines and AI tools in particular. These systems provide fast, accurate answers—yet users often report a surprising drop in satisfaction or curiosity once their questions are resolved. Socratic Misalignment proposes that this reaction occurs because the true value of the question was relational, and the mechanical nature of the answer bypasses that deeper human need.</p>
    <p>By highlighting the social dimension of inquiry, the theory invites new perspectives in fields like information science, education, and communication. It challenges the assumption that efficient information delivery is always the goal and underscores the importance of questions as tools for emotional attunement and social presence.</p>
