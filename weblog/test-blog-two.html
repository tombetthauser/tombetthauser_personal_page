    <h2>blog test STWL</h2>
    <p>this is another test for a blog that isn't really a blog cause it's just a test. I'm just going to voice to text a bunch of nonsense. It's really cool that we have the technology to take random voices and send them to text. It seems like this is actually not a very good use of this technology.</p>
    <p>It's really cool that you say. NEWPARAGRAPH it makes a paragraph for youbut anyway  , but anyway, I should probably stop talking now because this is a waste of technology.</p>
    <p>So this is maybe the last thing that I'll say. Or maybe just one more little paragraph after this.</p>
    <p>Yeah, this will be the last one I think.</p>
